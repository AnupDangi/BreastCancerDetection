```bash
  cd BreastCancerDetection
```
## Note : Don't try to modify the dataset file it will affect the trained model.

Install all the required libraries ie pandas,numpy,matplotlib,scikit-learn and few others.

Here is the example below.Similarly install all of them.
```bash
  pip install pandas
```

 Run locally i mostly prefer jupyter notebook 
Each block of code or run it manually by clicking run button
```bash
